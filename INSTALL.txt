Pine example (Mac OS X):
To install Pine, is no much more than installing Pinax. After installing Pinax
(we use the 0.7 release with a few bugfixes that should be merged into Pinax
soon) you should get a virtual environment with all the Pinax requirements in
it. All you then need to do, is to activate the virtualenv and move to the
pine folder. Then all that is needed to get your local django server up and
running is to do the following commands:

    $ python manage.pu syncdb
    $ python manage.py runserver

note that you may want to change the database settings and use a different
database backend. The default is sqlite3.





Basic project example:
Currently broken, do not try to use yet. Instead use an older version of wait
for an update, where this examples shortcommings has been fixed.
