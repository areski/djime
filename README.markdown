Djime - A Django-based time tracking tool
=========================================

We're in the process of shuffling Djime a bit around, making it more
plugable by separating the apps from the rest. Sorry for the mess!

External django apps needed:
[django-pagination](http://code.google.com/p/django-pagination/ "django-pagination at google code"),
maintained by Eric Florenzano.

[South](http://south.aeracode.org/ "South project homepage") by Andrew Godwin
and Andy McCurdy.
