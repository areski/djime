Djime - A Django-based time tracking tool
=========================================

Djime is a an open source project. We are working to create a good time
tracking and billing tool using the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) 
Web framework.

The team behind this project is still fairly small, but feel free to join us.

We have:
* a [bug tracker on Github](http://github.com/djime/djime/issues).
* an IRC channel, #djime, on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) network.
* a [Google Groups mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/djime).

[The source code](http://github.com/djime/djime/tree/master) is also managed on Github.
