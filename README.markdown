The team behind this project is still fairly small, but feel free to join us.

We have:

* a [bug tracker on Github][issues].
* an IRC channel, #djime, on the [Freenode][] network.
* a [Google Groups mailing list][ggroup].

[The source code](http://github.com/djime/djime/tree/master) is also managed on Github.
