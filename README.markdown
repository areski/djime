Djime - A Django-based time tracking tool
=========================================

Djime is a an open source project. We are working to create a good time
tracking and billing tool using the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) 
Web framework.

The team behind this project is still fairly small, but feel free to
join us. We have an IRC channel, #djime, on the
[Freenode](http://freenode.net/) network, and a [Google Groups mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/djime).
